Object model
------------

This protocol uses the Datex II (datex2.eu) meta-model for its
object model. Meta model consists of a set of rules that describe how
classes and objects are defined. The reason why the Datex II meta-
model has been adopted is that it will eventually provide the
possibility for this protocol to become an international standard that
can later be included with the object model for Datex II.

The object model is technology independent, ie can be implemented in
various ways such as using **ASN.1**, **JSON** or **XML**. However, the
communication between the site and supervision systems / other sites
uses **JSON** format.
